# Data Engineering Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my **Data Engineering Portfolio**. This repository contains various projects demonstrating my expertise in **data engineering, ETL pipelines, and data processing**. Each project folder contains relevant scripts, documentation, and datasets used to perform specific tasks.

## Projects

### [Banks ETL Project](./Banks%20ETL%20Project/)
**Description**: This project extracts financial data from multiple bank websites using **web scraping** techniques, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into a database for further analysis. The project leverages **Python, Pandas, and BeautifulSoup** for data extraction and processing.

### [PEP8 Analysis](./PEP8%20Analysis/)
**Description**: This project integrates **PEP8 compliance checks** into the `pylint` package, ensuring that Python scripts follow best coding practices. It analyzes the code structure, formatting, and adherence to PEP8 standards using **pylint** and **flake8**.

### [Pipelines Global Investment Portfolios](./Pipelines%20Global%20Investment%20Portfolios/)
**Description**: This project focuses on designing and implementing **data pipelines** that automate data ingestion, transformation, and storage. It demonstrates the use of **Apache Airflow** and **ETL best practices** to streamline data workflows.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Engineering-Portfolio.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Banks ETL Project
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in each project's `README.md` to set up and execute the pipeline.
